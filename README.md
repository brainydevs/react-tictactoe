## React Tic Tac Toe
This project is a small game to mess around with React.

It includes my implementation of the following exercises from the [official React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html):

- [x] Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
- [x] Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
- [x] Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- [x] Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- [x] When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
- [x] When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
